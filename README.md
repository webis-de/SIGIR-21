# SIGIR-21


This repository contains the data and code for reproducing results of the paper: The Information Retrieval Anthology.


The results were produced using the [interactive Leipzig Corpus Miner](https://github.com/ChristianKahmann/ilcm_Shiny). A local installation is possible via [Docker](https://hub.docker.com/r/ckahmann/ilcm), which in turn allows a reproduction of the results.
